# HumorHaven
A dynamic website created in PHP and connected to a MySQL database and hosted through Apache webserver. (Plus site is encrypted!!!)

Humor Haven is a simple jokes & puns website allowing users to access a DB filled with humour to enhance their personality and charm. The website has features for selecting jokes with specific keywords or allowing users to add their own jokes. This project was created to improve my personal skills with PHP, HTML, MySQL, and web hosting with web servers like Apache.
